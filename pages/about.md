## About MAPS

The Maine-Aomori Printmaking Society (MAPS) was a transnational printmaking exchange program between Maine and Aomori. 

Running from 2015 through 2020, MAPS celebrated the Maine-Aomori Sister-State relationship through the exchange of prints by professional artists who live, work, or have a deep connection with the Maine and/or Aomori regions. 

Every year, 20 prints by 20 artists were exchanged and exhibited in venues across Maine and Aomori. Artist delegations and artist residencies in both Maine and Aomori were realized as the program progressed. 

The MAPS program was volunteer-led and community-built, supported by the Munakata Shik≈ç Museum of Art in Aomori City, Japan, and its Director, Jiro Ono; MAPS Program Coordinator Jeff Badger, Pickwick Press in Portland, Maine; Board Members of Friends of Aomori, based in Portland, Maine; The Consulate-General of Japan in Boston, University of Southern Maine student interns, and local vendors, venues, and community spaces where MAPS and its story were shared with the public.

Although MAPS has concluded its five-year run, a childrens' printmaking exchange was founded under the MAPS program in 2018 by Briar Pelletier of Friends of Aomori. The program evolved into an annual program under the name Hashi - or "bridge" in Japanese - under Maine educator Reaghan Russell. The Hashi program features student prints from elementary and middle school students in Maine and Aomori schools. Hashi is currently run by Lynn McCann-Olson, current President of Friends of Aomori.
